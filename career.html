        <p>He grew up in Delhi and was one of the first to train at the West Delhi Cricket Academy, created in 1998. 
            In 2002 he played for the Delhi Under-15 team and was the highest run scorer in the 2003–04 Vijay Merchant 
            Trophy, playing for the Delhi Under-17 team.

            In February 2006, Kohli made his domestic debut for Delhi in a one-day match against Services (a team 
            representing the Indian armed forces) but did not get a chance to bat. He scored only 10 runs in his 
            first-class debut (first-class cricket refers to matches that last three or more days and feature two 
            sides of 11 players each) against Tamil Nadu in November that year. He scored 90 runs in difficult 
            conditions in a first-class match against Karnataka in December, helping Delhi draw the Test. In April 
            2007, he scored 35 runs in his T20 domestic debut against Himachal Pradesh.
            
            Kohli captained the Under-19 Indian cricket team to victory at the ICC Under-19 World Cup in Kuala Lumpur,
            Malaysia, in 2008. His exploits were rewarded with an IPL contract from RCB for $30,000. He also made his 
            international debut in an ODI that year, opening the batting and scoring 12 in a defeat of Sri Lanka in 
            Dambulla, Sri Lanka. In 2009 he scored 405 runs in nine innings in the Emerging Players Tournament in 
            Australia, ensuring that he would be at the top of the national team selectors’ minds.

        <h2>PLAYING STYLE</h2>
        <img src="https://im.rediff.com/cricket/2024/jan/15kohli1.jpg?w=670&h=900" height="300" width="500" alt="Virat Kohli Playing Style">

        <p>
            Kohli is considered as an enterprising batsman, possessing technical abilities and a dynamic playing 
            demeanour. His customarily batting position in ODI cricket is at number three, with a slightly 
            open-chested stance, and a resolute grip on the bottom handle of his bat. He has been noted for his 
            agile footwork, expansive range of strokes, and his propensity for adeptly orchestrating innings whilst 
            thriving in high-pressure situations. In his batting technique, Kohli tends to favour playing 
            grounded shots rather than attempting big hits. He is appreciated for his ability to execute wrist shots 
            and his consistent prowess in the mid-wicket and cover region.
            Kohli has often expressed his admiration for the cover drive, which he considers to be his signature stroke.
            He possesses a natural aptitude for the flick shot, particularly when facing deliveries aimed towards leg 
            stump. Having a limited recourse to the sweep shot, Kohli's batting technique is characterized by an 
            emphasis on ground shots that primarily yield runs in the regions between deep square leg and mid-on. 
            Kohli is known for his composed batting technique and versatility in his play. He scores runs between 
            long-off and long-on with an aligned bat, while also possessing the ability to display a destructive streak.
            His combination of bat-speed and supple wrist movements enable him to craft innovative angles that disrupt 
            traditional field positioning. Kohli is also a proficient fielder, recognized for his quick reflexes 
            and sure-handedness.

        <h2>AGGRESSION</h2>
        <img src="https://static.india.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Virat-Kohli-celebrating-the-Australian-wicket-during-1st-Test-in-Adelaide_Getty.jpg?impolicy=Medium_Resize&w=1200&h=800" 
        height="350" width="500" alt="Virat Kohli Aggression">

        <p>Kohli's playing style is widely regarded as aggressive, a trait that extends to his leadership on the field.
             He is well known for his passionate and animated responses to on-field situations, demonstrating a fierce
             competitiveness. His captaincy is characterized as proactive, taking bold decisions and leading 
             the team by example. Kohli has been the subject of much media scrutiny and criticism in the early 
             stages of his career. He was often portrayed as a brash and arrogant individual, eliciting mixed reactions
             from fans, critics and former cricketers alike. While some have praised his assertiveness and 
             confidence, others have criticized Kohli's behaviour for crossing the boundaries of fair play and
             for losing control, sometimes resulting in a loss of composure. Despite his efforts to curb his 
             aggressive behaviour, Kohli has acknowledged that there are times when intense pressure or high-stakes 
             situations may challenge his resolve. Nevertheless, the cricketer has persistently maintained that his 
             aggression acts as a source of inspiration and drives his focus and motivation on the field. Writing 
             for The New York Times, Huw Richards noted Kohli's self-assuredness and "assertiveness" in contrast to 
             some former Indian cricketers who he felt had exhibited an inclination towards excessive politeness and 
             reticence, and that Kohli embodies his combative demeanour both on and off the cricket field.
