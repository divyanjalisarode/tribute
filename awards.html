                Kohli has garnered 10 ICC Awards which is more than any player in International Cricket, making him 
                the most decorated player in International Cricket history. He won the ICC ODI Player of the Year 
                award four times in 2012, 2017, 2018, and 2023. He also won the Sir Garfield Sobers Trophy, given 
                to the ICC Cricketer of the Year, on two occasions, in 2017 and 2018 respectively. In 2018, he became 
                the first player to win both ICC ODI and Test Player of the Year awards in the same year. Also, he was 
                named the Wisden Leading Cricketer in the World for three consecutive years, from 2016 to 2018. Kohli 
                has the second most and most 'Player of the Match' and 'Player of the Series' awards to his name, 
                respectively, in all three formats combined. At the national level, Kohli was honoured with the 
                Arjuna Award in 2013, the Padma Shri in 2017, and India's highest sporting honour, the Khel Ratna Award,
                in 2018. In 2018, Time magazine included him on its list of the 100 most influential people in the 
                world.
