        <p>Kohli's romantic association with Bollywood actress Anushka Sharma, which commenced in 2013, earned the 
        duo the moniker of "Virushka". During an interview with Graham Bensinger, Kohli divulged that he had 
        encountered Sharma for the first time, when they were both were engaged in a promotional shoot for Clear 
        shampoo. Their union since then has attracted significant media interest, with persistent rumours and 
        speculations swirling around in the press, as both parties remained reticent about publicly discussing the 
        relationship. On 11 December 2017, the couple exchanged nuptials in an intimate ceremony held in Florence, 
        Italy, becoming one of the most talked-about celebrity couples in the country. On 11 January 2021, the 
        couple had their first child, a daughter, who was named Vamika. The child's name, Vamika, is derived from 
        Sanskrit, meaning "little goddess". On 15 February 2024, the couple welcomed their second child, a boy 
        named Akaay.</p><br><br>

        <p>In 2018, Kohli disclosed that he had made the decision to adopt a vegetarian diet in an effort to alleviate 
        the symptoms of a cervical spine issue caused by elevated levels of uric acid. This condition was impacting 
        his finger movements, and thus, affecting his performance as a batsman. He made a conscious effort to abstain 
        from consuming meat, as part of his regimen for maintaining optimal health. He has since clarified that his 
        dietary choices do not align with a vegan lifestyle and he continues to consume dairy products and eggs 
        effectively making what is known in India as an eggetarian. Kohli is widely recognized 
        for his physical fitness and intense training regimen. He has been an advocate of leading a healthy 
        lifestyle, which involves regular exercise and a nutritious diet. His hard work and discipline in this area 
        have earned him the reputation of being one of the fittest cricketers in the world.<br><br>

        Kohli has acknowledged to harbour a belief in superstitions. He has publicly avowed his reliance upon various 
        lucky charms and rituals that he feels serve to bring him good fortune on the cricket field. One such tradition 
        involves the donning of black wristbands, which he adheres to as a talismanic tradition. Additionally, he is 
        known to prefer a particular pair of gloves, which he has consistently worn due to their supposed propensity 
        to bring him success. Furthermore, Kohli has been observed sporting a kara, a traditional bangle often worn 
        for religious or spiritual purposes, on his right arm since 2012. In addition to the previously mentioned 
        superstitions, Kohli has also established the ritual of consistently donning white shoes on the cricket field.
        Kohli has tattoos of the revered Hindu deity Lord Shiva, the sacred syllable "Om", the names of his 
        parents, Prem and Saroj, a tribal emblem, a representation of a serene monastery, a samurai warrior, the 
        astrological symbol of the scorpion, and his ODl and Test match cap numbers.</p>
